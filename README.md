# Get it Done
## By Jacen Green

## Summary
Get it Done (GiD) is a free proof-of-concept productivity app designed for individuals who want to a tool to help assist manage a personal project or for small-scale collaborations which could benefit from task delegation and tracking without the need for immediate communication. The app is designed to be simpler and easier-to-use than it's competition while giving a slick user experience that encourages productivity with it's use of colours, animations and general design aesthetic - it's fun to use!

# üí† Process

## Problem Statement
> You have seen a gap in the market for a productivity app which does not focus entirely on function, but rather bridges the gap between a simple task manager app and a more complicated project manager app that offers a potentially overwhelming experience for new collaborators and individuals who want to improve their productivity and planning.
<br>
<br>

## Design (wireframing)
<details>
 <summary> See Wireframes üîç</summary>
 
 ### Low fidelity wireframing -> Balsamiq
 Low fidelity wireframes were created using Balsamiq to touch upon all aspects of the app's deisgn requirements.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>

 **Home Page: Intro splash screen**
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f87c3632-65ee-47b6-b900-865d0749d827)
 The initial thought process was to create a stylistic and clean looking home 'splash' screen, not dissimilar to a game loading screen - the 
 goal being to immediately engage the user and hook their attention by inducing a sense of wonder.
 <br>
 <br>
 Blue arrows indicate animation directions; The Page will start with the site logo loaded, which will split into to halves and reveal the 
 name of the site, before continuing it's animation by highlighting and revealing directive text to motivate the user. Afterwards the logo 
 and text will transition off the screen into the login screen.
 <br>
 <br>
 The app would mostly remain consistent from desktop to tablet screens, and have layout changes for mobile devices - in this case the edges 
 of the logo would dissapear off the edge of the screen after splitting.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>

 **Login screen (home page)**
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8abeac1-eb97-48b7-b7f3-8a100d1ed534)
 [The login screen which the home screen 'rests' on after the completed animation] A simple login screen with minimal elements focuses the 
 user on their only real next step, since a login is required to use the site.
 <br>
 <br>
 If a user is already logged in or has an existing login token which has not expired, then the animations would play out before transitioning 
 to the Epics page. If a new account needs to be registered then the login screen will transition to a similar register screen after clicking 
 the button.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>

 **Epics page (Get Started)**
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c139a08-b133-4319-9db5-0499c49bfe23)
 If no Epics have yet been created then the user would be shown the above page. Clicking on [get started] will continue to the create Epics 
 page where information can be added and tasks can be created.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>

 **Epics page (display panel)**
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b36c0ced-92ac-40f2-b053-d2b3b1490695)
 If data exists for epics on the database then the Epics card panel will display with some summary information as well as the chosen image 
 for the Epic. Users would be able to scroll through more cards if the maximum page display for cards is exceeded. From here Epics can be 
 selected to be redirected to the Tasks page, or by clicking an edit icon the Epic View page will be shown where CRUD functionality can be 
 actioned provided superuser access is granted.
 <br>
 <br>
 On mobile devices this would display in a list format instead to save space.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 
 **Tasks page (display panel)**
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/278dc298-01c3-4464-a4ee-71ea78332012)
 The task version of the Epics page, showing once an Epic has been selected. Here Task summary information is shown and tasks can be selected 
 to either be viewed in detail or, given appropriate access, updated or deleted after confirmation from the superuser.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>

 **Epic/Task View page**
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5752993-dec8-469f-bf9e-91efa599bc0f)
 This view page is where users can carry out CRUD actions or view a given card in further detail.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>

 **Profile page**
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f703d87-ce30-44a4-9ba8-686ef3465dfe)
 For a small amount of user customisation, a profile page will also exist. Here users can add personal information about themselves and add a 
 profile image/avatar that other collaborators will see as assignees on Tasks and Epics. The page would also show some statistics, for 
 example how many Tasks have been assigned to them. Additionally, a Profile List page would also be added so that users can view all other 
 collaborators involved with the project.

<br>

## Themes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8605fd8-ce9c-41a1-9c29-61c54621fd54)
<br>
The blue colour palette used above is used to set the overally theme for the app. During research into theming, blue was highlighted as the most common colour for general productivity and focus. As a result the various shades are used to add accents and detaiils to titles, buttons and various other interactable elements - allowing differentiation in a simplistic yet stylistic design that further pushes user engagement.
<br>
<br>
The colour pallet was taken from a website called VENNGAGE: https://venngage.com/blog/blue-color-palettes/
<br>
<br>
With regards to the general CSS styling of the app, Bootsrap React was used to degree - although for a truly custom feeling design most of the CSS was custom made for this project. Many fonts had been looked at with the use of googlefonts, however ultimately it was decided that the default React font fit the design aesthetic perfectly; sans-serif, circular curves to the text that was simple and serious enough to enhance the app's overall design focus while resembling the custom logo.
<br>
<br>
<br>

## App name & Custom Logo
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/933a9a2b-7d80-4103-9ab1-a716043fe617)
<br>
With the idea of a task management app I eventually landed on the name 'Get it Done', or 'GiD' (abbreviated). It is short, easy to remember and acts as a motivational phrase with the use of authoritative text, calling the user immediately to action.
<br>
<br>
The set of logos above were created using an online source - express.adobe.com. GiD would subsequently spark the idea of a logo which was circular in design, where the G and D could be joined together by an 'i' in the center to create a full a circle; representing continuity of action and cycles of development. Colouring was driven by the colour pallet identified above and would remain consistent throughout the app.
Furthermore, the circlular design with two halves would allow for animation where it could be split into two halves.
<br>
<br>
It became apparent that the details of the main logo (left hand image) would be far too hard to see as a favicon icon. Thus a second alternative logo was produced with more thickness that could be identified more easily from a browser tab, yet still be recognisable and consistent with the main logo - however in this case the imagery resembles a door and lock as a result of the symmetry that was introduced to 'clean' up the icon at such small scales.

## Planning and MOSCOW modelling:

Following agile methodology a great deal of time was spent setting up the project kanban and other various boards where the project could be visualised in. They would be split into 5 key displays:

### 1. User Story Table<br>
This table shows all user stories at a glance, along with their MOSCOW and EPIC allocations. The project is split into 3 main epics based on the relationships the stories have with each other, and are all labeled by priority using MOSCOW terminology.<br>
Each user story was given 1-3 acceptance criteria based on the scale and complexity of each story.<br>

</details>
<br>

### 2. Progress Board<br> 
This board displays the active progress of the project; filtered to only show the user stories as tasks have their own table and are labled as complete there.<br>

</details>
<br>

### 3. MOSCOW Board<br>
This board displays the allocation of each user story to Must Have, Should Have, Could Have and Won't Have fields; they can then be labelled when viewed in other displays such as the User Story Table.<br>

</details>
<br>

### 4. Tasks Table<br>
This table displays a breakdown of all created tasks in lists below each user story. Miscellaneous tasks that were deemed necessary as part of production but were not directly tied to a user story were categorised as 'General Tasks' as seen at the bottom highlighted in orange.
Tasks were labelled further with the Sprint field, which relates to another board used to define a number of Sprints based on groups of tasks.

</details>
<br>

### 5. Sprints Board
Finally the Sprints Board, as mentioned above, displays a breakdown of the individual sprints planned for the project - each containing groups of development-related tasks across the different user stories or general tasks that were created.>br>
Each sprint timebox would be set to 1 week cycles, however with the limited experience learnt for react and DRF leading up to this project significantly more time was taken for the sprints to be completed.<br>

## Data Models
The data models created for this project, along with their accompanying desciptions are displayed in the image below:<br>
<details>
 <summary> See detail</summary>
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cb63f1f-375c-4f3b-be72-649ce2c5890f)

<br>

All models relate to a single hemogenous app, where each data model is simple in nature due to the relatively simple function of said app.
<br>
<br>
üî∑ **Profile model**: This model effectively acts as a custom extension of the default django user model.<br>
üîπ `owner` - This OneToOne directly relates to the default django user model id (where created profiles are stored on the DB).<br>
üîπ `name` - This field allows for a custom name to be set by the user, which will be displayed when fetching the profile-name data.<br>
üîπ `title` - This field allows for a custom title, such as 'junior develepor' or 'project leader', which will be displayed on the profile.<br>
üîπ `image` - This field allows the user to upload a custom image or avatar to be displayed within the app and profile page.<br>
üîπ `created_at` - This field stamps when the user was created.
üîπ `updated_at` - This field stamps how long ago an update was made by the user to their profile.<br>
<br>

üü£ **Epic model**: This model allows users to create Epics, which each have subdivisions of tasks, to help an individual or team organise and plan their project workload.<br>
üî∫ `title` - This field sets the title for a given epic.<br>
üî∫ `image` - This field allows a user to upload an image for an epic, allowing for visual differentiation between them.<br>
üî∫ `created_by` - This OneToOne field relates to the user who created the epic.<br>
üî∫ `status` - This field relates to a table of 4 status choices; the user can set an epic as 'To-do', 'In Progress', 'Completed', or 'Backlog'.<br>
üî∫ `created_at` - This field stamps when the epic was created.<br>
üî∫ `updated_at` - This field stamps how long ago an update was made by the user to the epic, allowing users to see the activity of said epic relative to others.<br>
<br>

üî∂ **Task Model**: This model allows the creation of multiple tasks for a given Epic and allows users to set SMART goals with the aid of priority and completion-date allocation.<br>
üî∏`title` - This field sets the title for a given task.<br>
üî∏`description` - This field allows the user to create a small description/summary for the task which other users can view.<br>
üî∏`assigned_to` -  This OneToMany field shows which other users have been assigned to a given task.<br>
üî∏`created_by` - This OneToOne field relates to the user who created the task.<br>
üî∏`status` - This field relates to a table of 4 status choices; the user can set a task as 'To-do', 'In Progress', 'Completed', or 'Backlog'.<br>
üî∏`priority` - This field relates to a table of 3 priority choices; the user can set a task as 'LOW', 'MEDIUM' or 'HIGH' priority.<br>
üî∏`created_at` - This field stamps when the task was created.<br>
üî∏`updated_at` - This field stamps how long ago an update was made by the user to the task, allowing users to see the activity of said task relative to others.<br>
üî∏`completion_date` - This field allows a user to set a date in which a task is proposed to have been completed by.<br>

**Responsiveness**
- This particular project was created mainly for desktop and tablets for business use as a way to manage and create bookings more-so than for users to create their own, albeit an option. 

**Code Validation**
W3C Markup Validation Service
JSHint
PEP8

All of the above validations were passed:
- All custom python files met pep8 criteria
- No javascript was used in the project
- All html source code checked for and found zero errors at this stage of deployment.

## Deployment
**Heroku Deployment**

  </details>
  
- Within the `Settings` menu, navigate to `Config Vars` (Also known as *Environment Variables*).<br>
  This is where private and sensitive data, such as credentials and keys, will be stored for the project.

  </details>

- If the project is dependant on a creds.json file, then this is where the data will be stored.
- Click `Reveal Config Vars`. For initial deployment of a full-stack project:<br>
  `KEY`: 'DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC'. `VALUE` '1'<br>
  This will prevent Heroku from uploading static files to the build.<br>
  Later on, once the project has been configured with a local static file directory, this KEY/VALUE pair can be removed.
- Note that any other secret keys such as links to the prject's database will be added as the project develops.<br>
  The image below shows an example of the `config vars` panel used in a previous project.

  </details>

- A final component required for successful deployment is the use of a `Procfile`:
    - Heroku will read this file to determine how to start the server.
    - Within the Procfile a python package called *gunicorn* is referenced as a production-ready webserver for Heroku to use.
    - After installing gunicorn and adding it to the `requirements.txt` file, the following line of code needs to be added to
      the Procfile `web: gunicorn my_project.wsgi`.
    - Note that a blank line after the above code may be either required or need to be removed for Heroku to read it successfully.

### Connect to GitHub and deploy:

- Navigate to the `Deploy` menu. For `Deployment method` select GitHub. Finally, you can manually deploy the project.
